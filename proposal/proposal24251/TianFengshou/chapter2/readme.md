The review covers various aspects such as key components, theoretical frameworks, critical analysis of existing studies, positioning of the current research, and identification of research gaps.

### 2.2 Key Components
The research title can be breakdown into five key components, including: temporal analysis, climatic influences, forest fire patterns, peninsular Malaysia, and statistical method. The literature review of each key component will be presented in the following sessions.

#### 2.2.1 Temporal Analysis
Temporal analysis is a method used to study data patterns over time, helping researchers and analysts understand trends, cyclical behaviours, and temporal relationships within datasets. This approach is crucial in various fields such as climatology (Belay et al., 2021), economics (Liu & Song, 2020), and social sciences (Cencetti et al., 2021), where understanding time-based data is essential. The temporal analysis from the studies involved several techniques, including time series analysis, spatial-temporal analysis and temporal network analysis.

The evolution of temporal analysis has been marked by the improvements in computing capability and the creation of advanced algorithms. Early studies primarily focused on simple time series models, such as ARIMA in 1976 and exponential smoothing in 1950 (G. Jain, n.d.). However, recent advancements have introduced more complex models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), which offer superior performance in capturing long-range dependencies in data (Gopali et al., 2021). The integration of machine learning with temporal analysis has opened new avenues for predictive analytics, enabling the capture of non-linear relationships and long-term dependencies with superior accuracy, albeit at the cost of higher computational demands (Siami-Namini et al., 2018).

Several case studies highlight the practical applications of temporal analysis. For instance, in healthcare, temporal analysis has been used to monitor patient vitals and predict potential health crises, leading to timely interventions (T. Chen et al., 2021). In finance, it has been utilized to forecast stock prices by analysing stock price patterns over time (Asgarov, n.d.). The integration of temporal analysis in environmental monitoring shows great promise, particularly in flood mapping, forestry, and water resource management (Amitrano et al., 2021). These case studies demonstrate the versatility and importance of temporal analysis in addressing real-world problems.

The importance of temporal analysis lies in its ability to transform raw time-based data into actionable insights, enabling informed decision-making across various domains. By understanding temporal dynamics, organizations can better anticipate future trends, optimize operations, and enhance risk assessment and damage analysis (Ahola et al., 2007). The continuous evolution of temporal analysis techniques, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and computational methods, ensures that it remains a vital tool for researchers and practitioners alike. In conclusion, temporal analysis is indispensable in modern data analysis, providing a deeper understanding of temporal patterns and their implications (Tang & Wang, 2021).

#### 2.2.2 Climatic Influences
Climatic influences refer to the various ways in which climate conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns, affect natural and human systems. These influences are critical in understanding the dynamics of ecosystems, agricultural productivity, and human health, among other areas (Abbass et al., 2022). Climatic influences are studied through the lens of climate science, which examines the long-term trends and patterns in meteorological data to forecast future climatic conditions and their potential impacts (X. M. Chen et al., 2023). 

Research on climatic influences has undergone considerable development in recent decades. Initially, studies were largely observational, focusing on the direct effects of climate variables on specific regions or phenomena (Treut et al., n.d.). With the advancement of climate models and satellite technology, researchers can now simulate and predict climatic influences with greater accuracy (Fatichi et al., 2011). Recent developments in machine learning and big data analytics have further enhanced our ability to analyse complex climate data, leading to more nuanced insights into how climatic factors interact with various environmental and socio-economic systems (L. Chen et al., 2023).

Implementing studies on climatic influences involves a range of methodologies, from statistical analysis and climate modelling to field experiments and remote sensing. Climate models, such as General Circulation Models (GCMs), play an essential part in modelling the Earth's climate system and forecasting future weather patterns (Robock et al., 1993). Remote sensing technologies encompass satellite imagery as well as sensors positioned on the ground, provide valuable data on climatic variables and their spatial distribution (Thies & Bendix, 2011). Additionally, machine learning techniques are increasingly used to examine extensive datasets, recognize trends, and forecast outcomes about climatic influences (Ford et al., 2016).

Numerous case studies illustrate the practical applications of research on climatic influences. For example, in agriculture, studies have shown how changing precipitation patterns and temperature fluctuations impact crop yields, guiding farmers in adapting their practices to mitigate adverse effects (Lobell et al., 2006). In public health, research has highlighted the relationship between climate change and the spread of vector-borne diseases, informing public health strategies and interventions (Wu & Huang, 2022). Environmental studies have used climatic data to understand the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, leading to conservation efforts aimed at protecting vulnerable species and ecosystems (Pörtner et al., 2021).

Understanding climatic influences is crucial for formulating effective strategies for adaptation and mitigation in relation to climate change. By identifying how climatic factors affect various systems, policymakers and practitioners can make informed decisions to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance resilience (IPCC, 2021). The ongoing advancements in climate science and technology continue to improve our ability to predict and manage the impacts of climatic influences, underscoring their importance in addressing the global challenge of climate change (Hulme, 2015). In conclusion, research on climatic influences provides essential insights that drive both scientific understanding and practical actions to safeguard natural and human systems against the adverse effects of climate change (Wang et al., 2023).

#### 2.2.3 Forest Fire Patterns
Patterns of forest fires denote the spatial and temporal occurrence of wildfires in forested areas, including their frequency, intensity, and underlying causes. Understanding these patterns is crucial for managing forests, predicting future fire occurrences, and mitigating their impacts on ecosystems and human communities (Dastour et al., 2024). Forest fires, influenced by climatic conditions, vegetation types, and human activities, have been a natural part of many ecosystems, playing a role in nutrient cycling and habitat renewal (Pausas & Keeley, 2019).

The study of forest fire patterns has evolved significantly over the years, with advancements in remote sensing technologies, climate models, and data analytics. Earlier studies relied on ground-based observations and historical records to understand fire occurrences (Mangeon et al., 2016). With the advent of satellite imagery and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), researchers can now analyse large-scale fire patterns and monitor active fires in real-time (Szpakowski & Jensen, 2019). Recent advancements in machine learning and big data analytics have further enhanced the ability to predict fire occurrences and understand their drivers (P. Jain et al., 2020).

Implementing studies on forest fire patterns involves a blend of remote-sensing, climate modelling, and field data collection. Remote sensing technologies, such as MODIS and Landsat, provide valuable data on fire locations, burn severity, and vegetation types (Giglio et al., n.d.). Climate models help simulate the effects of climatic variables, such as temperature and precipitation, on fire patterns (Abatzoglou & Williams, 2016). Machine learning methodologies such as Random Forests and neural networks, are increasingly used to analyse complex datasets and predict fire occurrences based on various environmental and socio-economic factors (P. Jain et al., 2020).

Several case studies highlight the practical applications of research on forest fire patterns. For example, in the western United States, study has indicated that climate change and human interventions are contributing to an increase in both the frequency and severity of forest fires, leading to significant ecological and economic impacts (Halofsky et al., 2020). In Australia, studies have concentrated on comprehending the impact of severe weather phenomena, including heatwaves and droughts, in driving large-scale bushfires (Bradstock, 2010). These case studies demonstrate the importance of understanding forest fire patterns for effective fire management and policy-making (Bowman et al., 2009).

Analysing the patterns of forest fires is essential for creating effective strategies for fire management, mitigating fire risks, and protecting ecosystems and human communities. By identifying the factors that influence fire occurrences and their spatial and temporal distribution, researchers can inform fire prevention and response efforts (Moritz et al., 2014). The ongoing advancements in remote sensing, climate modelling, and data analytics continue to improve our understanding of forest fire patterns, underscoring their importance in addressing the challenges posed by increasing fire occurrences due to climate change (Stephens et al., 2012). In conclusion, research on forest fire patterns provides essential insights that drive both scientific understanding and practical actions to manage and mitigate the impacts of forest fires (Keeley & Syphard, 2021).

These techniques enable comprehensive analyses of the region's environmental and socio-economic landscapes.

Several case studies highlight the practical applications of research on Peninsular Malaysia. For instance, studies on deforestation and land use change have provided insights into the impacts of agricultural expansion and urbanization on natural habitats, informing conservation strategies (Abdullah & Hezri, 2008). Analysis of the socio-economic effects of tourism in Langkawi has highlighted both the benefits and challenges of tourism development, guiding policy interventions (Shafikhullah & Nayan, 2021). Additionally, research focusing on climate change adaptation in coastal regions has recognized effective methods to lessen the effects of increasing sea levels on at-risk coastal communities (Ercan et al., 2011).

Understanding the dynamics of Peninsular Malaysia is crucial for addressing the region's environmental and socio-economic challenges. Research provides essential insights for sustainable development, conservation, and policy-making, helping to balance economic growth with environmental protection (Kaur, n.d.). The continuous evolution of research methodologies and interdisciplinary approaches ensures that studies on Peninsular Malaysia remain relevant and impactful. In conclusion, the body of research from 2019 to 2023 highlights the importance of a comprehensive understanding of Peninsular Malaysia's complex landscapes, contributing to informed decision-making and sustainable futures (Muhmad Kamarulzaman et al., 2023).

#### 2.2.5 Statistical Method
Statistical methods involve mathematical and statistical techniques to analyse data, extract insights, and make inferences. These methods are used in various fields, including scientific research, business, and social sciences, to identify patterns, relationships, and differences within datasets. Descriptive statistics summarize data characteristics using measures like mean and standard deviation, while Inferential statistics employs hypothesis testing to make inferences about a population using data obtained from a sample. Parametric tests such as t-tests and ANOVA are employed to compare groups when the data meets certain assumptions, while non-parametric tests, including the Mann-Whitney U test, are utilized when these assumptions are not satisfied. The calculation of p-values is essential for assessing the level of support against a null hypothesis, guiding decisions on statistical significance. These techniques provide a rigorous framework for making evidence-based decisions and understanding complex data (Luz et al., n.d.).

The evolution of statistical methods has been marked by significant advancements over the past few decades. Initially, classical statistical techniques, such as regression analysis and hypothesis testing, dominated the field (Cameron & Trivedi, n.d.). However, the advent of computational power and the availability of large datasets have led to the development of more sophisticated methods, including machine learning algorithms and Bayesian statistics (Gelman et al., n.d.). Recent trends also emphasize the importance of robust statistical methods that can handle complex data structures and high-dimensional data (Fan et al., n.d.).

Implementing statistical methods involves stages such as data collection, data preprocessing, model selection, and validation. Techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, and ANOVA are widely used for predictive modelling and hypothesis testing (James et al., 2021). Advanced methods like ensemble learning, support vector machines, and neural networks have gained popularity for their ability to handle non-linear relationships and large datasets (Hastie et al., 2019). Moreover, the integration of statistical software, such as R and Python, has facilitated the implementation of complex statistical analyses and visualization (Wickham & Grolemund, n.d.).

Numerous case studies highlight the practical applications of statistical methods. In healthcare, statistical methods have been used to identify risk factors for diseases, evaluate treatment effectiveness, and predict patient outcomes (Damen et al., 2016). In economics, these methods help in analysing market trends, forecasting economic indicators, and assessing policy impacts (Stock & Watson, 2017). Environmental studies utilize statistical techniques to model climate change effects, assess pollution levels, and manage natural resources (Hastie & Tibshirani, 2020). These case studies demonstrate the versatility and importance of statistical methods in addressing real-world problems.

The importance of statistical methods lies in their ability to provide a rigorous framework for data analysis and decision-making. By enabling accurate data interpretation and inference, these methods support evidence-based practices across various disciplines (Al Musannah,  Sultanate of Oman et al., 2023). The continuous evolution of statistical techniques, driven by advancements in computational power and data availability, ensures that they remain relevant and effective in tackling modern data challenges (Efron & Hastie, 2016). In conclusion, statistical methods are fundamental tools in research and practical applications, offering robust solutions to understand and manage the complexities of data (Tukey, 1977).

### 2.3 Theoretical Framework
Understanding forest fire patterns requires a comprehensive approach that integrates various theoretical perspectives. By referring to the keywords identified in previous session, there are mainly three theories related to the study, including: Climate Change Theory, Fire Ecology, and Statistical Analysis. These theories are related to each other to provide a robust framework to explore the multifaceted nature of forest fires.

#### 2.3.1 Climate Change Theory
Climate change theory explains how human activities and natural processes alter climatic patterns, influencing weather conditions globally (Effects of Changing Climate on Weather and Human Activities, 2000). In the context of forest fires, climate change contributes to increased temperatures and prolonged dry spells, creating conditions that make forests more susceptible to fires. For example, in Peninsular Malaysia, these altered climatic conditions can exacerbate the frequency and intensity of ground, surface, and crown fires (Figure 2.3.1).
