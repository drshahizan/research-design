## Abstract

This study analysis public sentiment towards the free school meal program organized by the Indonesian Government using data from social media. This program aims to improve students' nutritional intake and help ease the burden on low-income families. However, this policy has drawn mixed reactions on social media, both in the form of support and criticism. Data was collected from various social media platforms and processed through data cleaning and modelling stages using machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Naive Bayes. The results of the analysis show that the SVM and Naive Bayes methods have a higher level of accuracy in classifying positive and negative sentiments than KNN. Overall, the majority of public sentiment towards this program is positive, reflecting support for the policy that is considered beneficial for students in need. However, there are also a number of negative sentiments that highlight issues of distribution and quality of service. These findings can provide insights for the government to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the program, as well as identify areas that need improvement.

## Research Objectives

1. To Gather Twitter information on the free lunch program with website scraping methods.
2. To Implement sentiment analysis to the gathered data in order to determine the public's perspective (positive, negative, or neutral).
3. To Categorize the sentiment-related primary subjects of public discourse.
4. To Present research to help policymakers and the government improve the caliber of social welfare initiatives.

## Scope of Work

**Included:**
- Analysis of existing free lunch initiatives in Indonesia.
- Data Collection: The Prabowo-Gibran government's free meal program is the source of data used, which was collected via Twitter using certain keywords and hashtags.
- Evaluation of program outcomes over the past 5 years.
- Sentiment Analysis Method: Naive Bayes Classifier, SVM, and KNN machine learning techniques were used in the analysis process.
- Topic Modeling: To find important themes in the data, unsupervised learning techniques will be applied.
- Time Frame: To understand the immediate response of the public, data analysis is limited to a specific time frame around the launch of the program

**Excluded:**
- Analysis outside Indonesia.
- Non-educational impacts unrelated to student performance.
