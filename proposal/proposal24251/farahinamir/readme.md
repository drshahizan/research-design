## Title: Landslide Susceptibility Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Abstract:
Malaysia situated far away from the Pacific Ring of fire that make it safe from catastrophic geological hazards like the earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes and volcano eruptions. However, Malaysia is not immune to geological disaster such as floods, landslide, sinkholes that has always led to loss of lives, extensive damage to infrastructures and environment. As Malaysia geographically located at the equator, this country receives high rainfall distribution and humidity throughout the year which cause to the floods and landslides, especially during the Northeast Monsoon that occurs from November to March every year. Landslides can be described as the large-scale movement of soil because of high water content in the soil. Heavy rainfall is the main factor of aggressive landslides. This can be proving with major landslide incidents occurred in Malaysia during the northeast monsoon season, such as the landslide tragedy at Father’s Organic Farm, Batang Kali, Selangor on 16 December 2022, and the collapse of the Highland Tower on 11 December 1993.  Therefore, early mitigation measures to avoid the recurrence of this incident are very important to protect the publics’ safety and reduce infrastructure damage. The analysis and prediction conducted in areas identified as having a high risk of landslides will help the authorities take early actions to protect the safety of the residents and reduced the landslides impacts. Machine learning techniques combined with ArcGIS software is the best tools for landslides susceptibility analysing and prediction that can improved the precision of geological hazards information and awareness to public.
