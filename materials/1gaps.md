# Research Gap

## Definition
A **research gap** is essentially an unanswered question or unresolved problem in a field, which reflects a lack of existing research in that space. It can also exist when there's already a fair deal of existing research, but where the findings of the studies pull in different directions, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. 

In the context of **Computer Science** and **Data Science**, research gaps can emerge in various areas. Here are some examples:

1. **New Concepts or Phenomena**: This type of research gap emerges when there’s a new concept or phenomenon that hasn’t been studied much, or at all. For example, when a new algorithm or data structure is introduced, there's an opportunity to explore its impacts on computational efficiency, its applications in different domains, etc¹.

2. **Disagreement Gap**: This type of gap exists when different studies have conflicting findings. For example, different machine learning models might have varying performance on the same dataset, and it's not clear which model is the best.

3. **Contextual Gap**: This type of gap exists when existing research has not been conducted in a specific context or condition. For example, a certain data analysis technique might work well in one domain (like healthcare), but it's not clear if it would work as well in another domain (like finance).

4. **Methodological Gap**: This type of gap exists when there are questions about the methods used in existing research. For example, there might be questions about the validity of certain data collection methods or the robustness of certain computational models.

Identifying these gaps requires a thorough understanding of the existing literature and a keen eye for details and patterns that have not yet been explored. Once a gap is identified, it can serve as a valuable starting point for new research.


## Identifying Research Gaps

Steps that can help you identify a research gap

1. **Review existing literature**: Conduct a thorough review of the existing literature in your research area. This will help you identify what has already been studied and what gaps still exist.

2. **Identify a research problem**: Identify a specific research problem or question that you want to address.

3. **Analyze existing research**: Analyze the existing research related to your research problem. This will help you identify areas that have not been studied, inconsistencies in the findings, or limitations of the previous research.

4. **Brainstorm potential research ideas**: Based on your analysis, brainstorm potential research ideas that address the identified gaps.

5. **Consult with experts**: Consult with experts in your research area to get their opinions on potential research ideas and to identify any additional gaps that you may have missed.

6. **Refine research questions**: Refine your research questions and hypotheses based on the identified gaps and potential research ideas.

7. **Develop a research proposal**: Develop a research proposal that outlines your research questions, objectives, and methods to address the identified research gap.

There are different types of research gaps that can be identified, and each type is associated with a specific situation or problem. Here are the main types of research gaps:

- **Theoretical Gap**: This type of research gap refers to a lack of theoretical understanding or knowledge in a particular area.
- **Empirical Gap**: An empirical gap occurs when there is a lack of empirical evidence or data in a particular area.

Remember, identifying a research gap requires critical thinking, creativity, and a thorough understanding of the existing literature. It is an iterative process that may require revisiting and refining your research questions and ideas multiple times.

## Common Pitfalls in Identifying Research Gaps
Identifying research gaps is a crucial part of the research process, but it can also be challenging. Here are some common pitfalls to avoid:

1. **Overwhelming Information**: Dealing with an enormous amount of information can be daunting. It's important to stay organized and focused on your research question³.

2. **Lack of Organization**: Some researchers may find it difficult to organize the information they have gathered³. Using tools like reference management software can help keep your sources organized.

3. **Ignoring Methodologies**: Not evaluating the methodologies employed in existing studies can lead to missed opportunities to identify limitations or weaknesses in research design, data collection, or analysis.

4. **Narrow Literature Review**: A common mistake is not conducting a thorough and wide-ranging literature review¹. This can lead to a narrow understanding of the field and missed research gaps.

5. **Ignoring Discrepancies**: Not noting discrepancies, unanswered questions, or areas where further investigation is warranted can lead to missed research gaps.

6. **Not Consulting Experts**: Not consulting with experts in your research area can lead to missed opportunities to identify additional gaps that you may have missed.

Remember, the process of identifying research gaps requires critical thinking, creativity, and a thorough understanding of the existing literature. It's an iterative process that may require revisiting and refining your research questions and ideas multiple times².
