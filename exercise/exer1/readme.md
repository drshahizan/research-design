## Exploring Your Research Topic

These exercises will help you delve into your chosen research topic within computer science or data science and lay the foundation for a strong introduction chapter.

**1. Brainstorming and Problem Identification:**

* **Objective:** Identify a specific problem or challenge within your chosen field. Go beyond surface-level challenges to identify a specific, well-defined problem within a broader field.
* **Instructions:** 
    * Start by researching a broad area within computer science or data science (e.g., machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing). Explore areas like Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, Data Visualization, and Big Data Analytics. Consider which problems pique your curiosity and ignite your desire to delve deeper.
    * Don't just skim the surface; actively seek out current advancements, identify trends, and pinpoint areas where limitations exist or questions remain unanswered. Research current trends to identify a gap in knowledge or an issue that sparks your research fire. Utilize academic journals, online resources, and conferences to stay abreast of the latest advancements.
    * Consider real-world applications of these areas and brainstorm any limitations or issues that arise. Look for bottlenecks, inconsistencies, or potential biases that create problems.
    * Once you have a comprehensive understanding of the chosen domain, brainstorm a list of potential problems. Prioritize those that pique your interest and hold significant real-world implications.
    * Don't be afraid to refine your problem scope further. As you delve deeper, aspects that initially seemed like separate issues might converge into a larger, more impactful research question.

**2. Problem Background:**

* **Objective:** Gain a historical and technical understanding of the problem within the computer science or data science domain.

* **Instructions:**
    * Research the evolution of the problem you've identified.
       * How did it emerge within the field?
       * What were the initial approaches to addressing it?
       * How have limitations in previous solutions contributed to the current state of the problem?
    * Explore the technical underpinnings of the problem.
       * What specific computer science or data science concepts are relevant?
       * Are there particular algorithms, data structures, or software frameworks that play a role?
         
**3. Motivation and Significance:**

* **Objective:** Explain the importance of addressing your identified problem.
* **Instructions:**
    * Go beyond simply stating the problem's existence. Research its impact on the broader field.
    * Research the impact of the chosen problem on the broader field. 
    * Consider potential consequences if left unaddressed. 
    * Use real-world examples to showcase the problem's significance. 
    * Explain how successfully addressing this problem can benefit the field and related industries. 

**4. Research Question Formulation:**

* **Objective:** Formulate a well-defined research question that guides your investigation.
* **Instructions:**
    * Based on your chosen problem, develop a specific question that you aim to answer through your research. 
    * Ensure the question is focused enough to be achievable but also offers valuable insights. 
    * Consider using question framing techniques like "How can...?" or "To what extent does...?"
    * Refine your question to ensure it sparks curiosity and guides your research steps. 

**5. Research Objectives:**

* **Objective:** Outline actionable steps (objectives) to answer your research question.
* **Instructions:**
    * Break down your overarching research question into smaller, achievable objectives. 
    * Each objective should be clear, measurable, and contribute directly to answering your main question. 
    * Consider aspects like data collection, methodology development, evaluation criteria, or specific outcomes to be achieved.
    * Ensure all objectives are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound). They should be achievable within your research timeframe and collectively lead to a successful completion of your research question.

**6. Define the Scope:**

* **Objective:** Write a detailed description of your chosen topic’s scope. This should include:
* **Instructions:**
    * The specific aspects of the topic you will focus on.
    * The limitations of your research.
    * The expected outcomes or contributions to the field.

**7. Significance of Contribution:**

* **Objective:** Understand existing research, identify gaps, and highlight the potential contribution of your study.
* **Instructions:**
    * Conduct a comprehensive literature review in your chosen area. 
    * Identify relevant studies that address similar problems or use related methodologies. 
    * Analyze existing literature to identify any limitations, unanswered questions, or areas for improvement. 
    * Explain how your research aims to address these gaps. Will you be proposing a novel approach, introducing a new dataset, or utilizing a different analytical technique?
    * Clearly articulate how your research will contribute valuable knowledge to the field and differentiate itself from existing work.

By completing these exercises, you'll gain a deeper understanding of your research topic, develop a clear research question and objectives, and articulate the significance of your work within the broader field.
