# Exercise 4: Chapter 2 – Literature Review  

## 🧾 Objective:
This practical exercise aims to help you **develop critical skills in searching, evaluating, and synthesizing literature** relevant to your research topic. The exercises are designed to simulate the steps in writing a high-quality literature review chapter for your research proposal or thesis.

## ✅ TASK INSTRUCTION

You are required to complete the following tasks divided into **three main parts (A, B, C)**. Please read the description for each task carefully and submit your work in a structured format using headings and tables where necessary. 

📌 **[Template](template.md)**

### 🧪 PART A: IDENTIFYING AND ORGANIZING LITERATURE

#### 📌 **Exercise 1: Keyword Formulation and Search Strategy**
- Identify **3 to 5 core keywords** from your research topic.
- Identify **2 to 3 synonyms** or related terms for each keyword.
- Construct a **Boolean search string** using operators (AND, OR, parentheses).
- Use this string to perform a search in **Scopus** and **Web of Science** databases.
- Select **5 peer-reviewed journal articles** (preferably from the last 5 years).

**Deliverables:**
- Boolean search string used.
- Screenshot of search results from both databases.
- List of selected articles with metadata:
  - Title, Author(s), Year, Journal, Abstract.

#### 📌 **Exercise 2: Literature Classification Table**
- Classify the selected 5 articles using the table below:

| No | Author(s), Year | Article Type | Domain Focus | Methodology | Recency | Relevance to Your Study |
|----|------------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------|--------------------------|
| 1  | e.g., Smith et al., 2022 | Empirical / Review / Theoretical | Machine Learning / Big Data etc. | Qualitative / Quantitative | 2022 | Clearly explain the relevance |

#### 📌 **Exercise 3: Citation Mapping**
- Use one of the following tools:
  - [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com)
  - [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai)
  - [Open Knowledge Maps](https://openknowledgemaps.org/)

- Upload or search one of your key articles and generate a citation or connection map.

**Deliverables:**
- Screenshot of the citation map.
- Identify and briefly explain the contribution of 2 influential or highly cited papers related to your topic (~150 words).

### 🧪 PART B: REVIEWING AND SYNTHESIZING LITERATURE

#### 📌 **Exercise 4: Literature Review Matrix/Table**
Create a literature review summary matrix:

| Author(s) | Year | Title | Research Objective / Problem | Methodology | Key Findings | Limitations | Relevance to Your Study |
|-----------|------|--------|-------------------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|--------------------------|


#### 📌 **Exercise 5: Research Gap Identification**
Analyze your literature review matrix and identify:
- What is already well-studied?
- What is inconsistent, under-researched, or not addressed?
- How does your study aim to fill this gap?

**Deliverable:**
- A paragraph (150–200 words) explaining the **research gap** and **how your study addresses it**.

#### 📌 **Exercise 6: Comparative Critical Analysis**
Select **2 articles** with different methodologies but addressing a similar issue.

**Write a critical comparison (200–250 words)**:
- Describe each approach and its strengths.
- Discuss which approach is more suitable for your research and why.

### 🧪 PART C: TOOLS AND DOCUMENTATION

#### 📌 **Exercise 7: Reference Management Tool**
- Import all 5 selected articles into **Mendeley**, **Zotero**, or **EndNote**.
- Generate a **formatted reference list in APA 7th Edition style**.
- Use these references in your literature review writing.

**Deliverables:**
- APA-formatted reference list.
- Evidence of reference manager use (e.g., screenshot or exported file).

#### 📌 **Exercise 8: Literature Review Quality Evaluation**
Choose **one article** and evaluate its literature review section. Discuss:
- Is the literature review well-organized?
- Does it synthesize or merely summarize?
- Are sources recent and relevant?
- Is there a clear research gap identified?

**Deliverable:**
- A 150-word written evaluation.

#### 📌 **Exercise 9: Mini Literature Review Writing**
- Write a **300-word literature review** based on the 5 articles.
- Use **in-text citations** and APA 7th reference style.
- End with **justification for your research** based on the identified gap.

## 📣 NOTES & SUPPORT
- All work must reflect your own critical thinking.
- Avoid plagiarism by citing all sources properly.
- For database access, use UTM library portal or consult your library team.
- If you face technical issues with citation tools or platforms, inform your lecturer early.
