# üìò **Exercise: Problem Formulation Based on a Case Study in Data Science**

**Module 2: Problem Formulation**  
**Level:** Applied Research Preparation  
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Deliverable:** Structured report (maximum 3 pages)

## üîç **Exercise Objective**

This exercise aims to strengthen students‚Äô ability to formulate a data science research problem by analyzing a real-world case study from a reputable academic source. The case must include a **research study published in the last 5 years** from a **Scopus- or Web of Science (WoS)-indexed journal**, and must involve a **real dataset**.

## üìÇ **Instructions**

### üü¶ STEP 1: Case Study Selection

- Select a **peer-reviewed journal article** (published between 2020‚Äì2025) from a **Scopus- or WoS-indexed source**.
- The article must:
  - Be relevant to **Data Science** (e.g., machine learning, predictive analytics, big data, data mining, etc.).
  - Contain or reference the use of a **public or proprietary dataset**.
  - Address a **specific research problem**.

> üí° Recommended databases:  
> - [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com)  
> - [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com)  
> - [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com)  
> - [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com)

## üß© **STEP 2: Structured Analysis and Problem Formulation**

You are to analyze the selected study and complete the following components:

### **1. Research Problem**

**Describe the central issue** addressed by the authors. Focus on:
- The knowledge gap
- The real-world relevance
- Why it is a problem worth solving

### **2. Problem Statement**

Formulate a clear **problem statement** based on the case study. Ensure it includes:
- Context
- Specific challenge
- Importance of resolution through data

> _E.g.: Despite the growing volume of digital healthcare records, predicting patient readmission risk remains unreliable due to data fragmentation and limited model generalizability..._

### **3. Research Questions and Hypotheses**

- Develop **2‚Äì3 research questions** inspired by the paper.
- For each, propose a corresponding **testable hypothesis**.

> _RQ1: What patient features most significantly influence 30-day readmission risk?  
H1: Patients with more than two chronic conditions are more likely to be readmitted within 30 days._

### **4. Research Aim**

Summarize the overall **purpose** of the study. Express this as a single, focused aim.

> _Aim: To build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of 30-day readmission among diabetic patients using EHR datasets._


### **5. Research Objectives**

List **3 measurable objectives** that support the research aim.  
Each should be a specific task that contributes to achieving the research goal.

> Examples:
- To clean and integrate structured EHR data from hospital records.
- To engineer features related to patient history and treatment frequency.
- To train and evaluate ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

### **6. Mapping: Problem ‚Üí Questions ‚Üí Objectives**

Using a table, demonstrate how your problem statement connects logically to your research questions and objectives.

| Problem Statement | Research Question | Objective |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Poor prediction of hospital readmission | What factors predict readmission? | Identify and extract key features from EHR data |

### **7. Research Scope**

Define:
- **Scope**: what will be included (e.g., dataset types, population)
- **Limitations**: what will be excluded and why

> _Scope: The study will include adults aged 18‚Äì65 with Type 2 diabetes using EHR data from two major hospitals.  
Exclusions: Pediatric cases and patients with incomplete data will not be considered._

## ‚úÖ **Submission Requirements**

- Title of the case study
- Full citation (APA format) with direct link to journal
- Structured answers to sections 1‚Äì7
- Attach dataset link (if available)
