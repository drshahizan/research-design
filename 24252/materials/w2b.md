## **Module 2: Problem Formulation in Data Science Research**

### **1. Part 1: What is a Research Problem?**

A research problem in Data Science refers to an identifiable gap in knowledge that a study intends to address using computational or data-driven methods. It usually originates from real-world challenges‚Äîlike predicting customer churn or improving fraud detection‚Äîand requires analytical solutions through data interpretation.

> According to Fedushko et al. (2024), formulating the right research problem in the field of data science involves analyzing practical challenges and translating them into scientifically investigable questions, often grounded in technology, data availability, and societal relevance.

### **2. Part 2: Developing a Problem Statement**

A problem statement articulates the core issue clearly and concisely. In Data Science, it should include:
- The domain context (e.g., health, finance, marketing)
- The data-driven opportunity
- The limitation of current methods
- The desired improvement

> For example, Rathore et al. (2024) discuss how the growing volume of unstructured text in e-health records presents a problem for accurate diagnostics. This calls for advanced NLP models‚Äîthus, a clear problem emerges.

### **3. Part 3: Formulating Research Questions and Hypotheses**

**Research Questions** drive the investigation and should be:
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable through data

**Hypotheses** are testable predictions. For instance:
- *RQ:* What factors most influence customer churn in telecom datasets?
- *Hypothesis:* Customers with high complaint frequency are more likely to churn.

> In Czarnecka‚Äôs (2024) work, nine hypotheses were formulated based on patterns in virtual team behavior‚Äîan approach highly adaptable to computational social science and behavioral analytics in Data Science.

### **4. Part 4: Research Aim**

The research aim provides a high-level purpose of the study. In data science, this could be:
> ‚ÄúTo develop a predictive model that enhances the accuracy of heart disease detection using multi-source clinical data.‚Äù

It should align with the overall goals of solving a practical problem through analytics.

### **5. Part 5: Research Objectives**

Objectives break the research aim into actionable goals. Example:
- To collect and preprocess patient health records
- To apply feature selection techniques
- To compare SVM, Random Forest, and Deep Learning models

> Ehrman (2024) emphasizes that clearly defined objectives guide methodology selection and help ensure that the scope is both realistic and measurable.

### **6. Part 6: From Problem Statement to Research Questions to Objectives**

This part illustrates **logical alignment**:
- **Problem Statement**: Low accuracy in predicting heart attacks from electronic health records
- **Research Question**: What ML model provides the highest predictive accuracy?
- **Objectives**: Gather EHR data, preprocess, apply ML models, compare results.

> Fedushko et al. (2024) outline this sequence as a fundamental framework for structured, hypothesis-driven research in business and data-driven applications.

### **7. Part 7: Research Scope**

Scope defines what **is and isn‚Äôt** included:
- **Included**: Age 30‚Äì70, structured medical records, public datasets
- **Excluded**: Pediatric cases, handwritten records

> The scope must be realistic for the given timeline and resources. Ehrman (2024) argues that poor scoping leads to ambiguous findings and replication issues.


## üîç **Case Study: Predicting Heart Disease Risk**

**Problem Statement**: Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death. Despite the availability of digital health records, risk prediction models are often underutilized or inaccurate.

**Research Questions**:
- What are the most predictive features in EHR datasets for heart disease?
- Can deep learning models outperform traditional models in risk prediction?

**Hypotheses**:
- H1: Deep neural networks outperform logistic regression in predicting heart disease using EHRs.
- H2: Cholesterol levels, age, and blood pressure are statistically significant predictors.

**Aim**: To develop a robust heart disease prediction model using machine learning techniques.

**Objectives**:
- Collect and clean data from the UCI heart disease dataset.
- Apply feature selection and engineering.
- Train and evaluate multiple ML models.

**Scope**:
- Adults aged 35‚Äì70
- Structured datasets (UCI repository)
- Evaluation based on precision, recall, F1-score
