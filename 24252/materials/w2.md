# ✅ Week 2: Introduction to Research Project (cont..)

This week introduces you to the foundations of your research journey in data science. The goal is to provide clarity on expectations, tools, and resources you’ll use throughout the research project.

## 📚 Recommended Resources

### 🔹 [Data Science Resources](../../materials/ds-resource.md)
A curated collection of articles, tutorials, tools, and guides useful for conducting research in Data Science.

### 📄 [Master Data Science Project Handbook](../../images/Project%20Handbook.pdf)
A complete guide that outlines:
- Project planning and execution strategies  
- Research methodology best practices  
- Expectations and assessment criteria for your final project  

It serves as your roadmap throughout the research journey.

## 📃 Research Proposal Samples

These sample proposals provide insight into formatting, structuring, and presenting a research idea effectively.

- 🔗 [Batch 2024-25/01 Proposal](../../proposal/proposal_2.md)  
- 🔗 [Batch 2023-24/02 Proposal](../../proposal/readme.md)  

Review them to understand how to present your topic, research questions, and objectives clearly.

## 🧠 GitHub Repository

Explore the GitHub repository provided for this course. It includes essential materials and practice exercises:

- 📘 [Literature Review Guidelines](../../materials/lr.md)  
- 📗 [Data Science Concepts & Notes](../../materials/ds.md)  

Use these to support your research writing and to gain deeper technical understanding.


## 🎓 Module 1: Research Methodology in Computing

This module helps you understand what research means in the context of computing and how it applies to academic degrees.
