I asked my travel agent today to ask the airline what will be the procedure for her entry, you know, just to be sure. He called and this stupid guy on the other end said that my sister, even tho has a UK PASSPORT also need a Malaysian visa. Now my travel agent has been asking around and i have been searching through the internet and every website says that you do NOT need a Malaysian Visa if you have a British passport.   Can someone here with a British passport who have been to Malaysia in recent times assure me that my sister does not need a visa. I'll repay you with good vibes and prayers and all that. Thank you.\",\n          \"I'm a college dropout, my first business was a success (peak T2-T3 income in kl) but being young, rich, and naive caused me to learn all the bad habits and be stagnant all the way until now (I'm early 30s M).  I didn't realize the harmful effect of being stagnant as I am comfortable since I am still having T15 income at such young age. Covid came and my business went downhill quickly, expecting my wife would at least support me mentally but instead she drained what is left in me and left, I have had suicidal thoughts from time to time since then.   Luckily I have savings, and my business is dying but still making some profits, otherwise, I think I will end up in the news and won't be posting here on Reddit already.  I am into tech business competing in the international markets, and being stagnant in this field is worse than in other fields. Currently, I have a few other projects in mind which are a lot more challenging and higher risk than the first one. I don't want to depend on third-party for the technical aspects of my business this time, just like it is a bad idea to open a restaurant if we don't know how to cook.  I already had production experience as I no longer depend on the third party to maintain my business, albeit only copy-paste and make adjustments most of the time I have confidence I can be a decent programmer if I dive deep into it. So I intend to invest a few years in hardcore learning, practice, and build everything by myself from scratch, from front-end to security.   I had finally learned not to put all the eggs in one basket, IT businesses can be easier to do part-time due to automation, so I wish to establish myself in corporate after I can call myself a full-stack programmer and have some non-hobby portfolio to show.   People say landing a job without connections is very difficult, not to mention I don't have a degree and I'm already in my mid 30s by the time I can call myself a full-stack developer and I have to compete with fresh uni grads. The more I think about this the more depressed I am. I really don't want to end up doing grab etc just to survive, that should be the last resort if I decided I wanted to continue to live.  Does anyone have guidance for me or have any success stories to share? I don't know what to do if my next business doesn't succeed. I just want a reset, but time doesn't flow backward :(\",\n          \"Simple. If living in Singapore has the same wage and cost of living as malaysia, Singaporeans would be desperate to leave.   Other than public transport and cleanliness and \\\"less corruption\\\" (really its debateable when we don't know what really goes on behind..) there's really nothing more to Singapore than just another westernised city.  Malaysia is a proper sized country with things to do, and the people here are suprisingly warmer and friendlier and the country actually has a culture.  Singapore just feels like a hollow city compared to Malaysia.   [Edit] probably some singaporeans are gonna be salty about it but its just my experience. I make good friends in SG too. But again its just my observations. And anecdotally I find many agree. How can we quantify culture on statistics? Hard to do. But ask most travelers about what they think of Singapore and they'll hardly ever mention culture. It's just a harsh reality of materialistic cities. But I find Singapore in comparison to Malaysia to be far colder, even when compared to KL.  Only downside of Malaysia is low income. Only upside of Singapore is high income. But we have to be careful with our expenses regardless.  As a half malaysian, part of me wished I instead had malaysian citizenship and Singaporean PR. That's the best of both worlds.   So i can empathise with the loathing of the government and all. But really, the grass isn't all that green here in Singapore. Recent survey show half of youngsters here having anxiety and depression. Good infrastructure and efficiency doesn't solve everything guys. Focusing so much on such can create new problems.  Plus the fact that Singapore is so small and claustraphobic. Does it surprise me that everytime they want to go Johor?  Also this extends further than Malaysia. I've heard similar complaints about life in SG comparing to others like Vietnam or Thailand for example (normally they marry a Viet or Thai or Indo then they have the option to move). Some try something new like New Zealand, some go back to their home country with their hard earned money. Many Singaporeans just retire overseas.  [Edit] Some people want to point out that Malaysia has similar levels of stress or anxiety but shouldn't it make you question why Singapore, an efficient,clean and modern country, has all the same levels of anxiety as that of Malaysia which has obviously less of the efficiency , cleanliness or safety of Singapore?  Also no its not a \\\"i want to move to malaysia\\\" post or \\\"i hate singapore\\\" post. It's more of looking at the countries' strengths and weaknesses, and for me a realisation that this whole idea of \\\"Singapore is just better all the time\\\" idea kind of needs to stop, which is the whole point of my post  Also I'm shocked by the number of agreeing comments, with some describing how I feel and even more accurately so. Talking to Malaysians in real life also, I get the sense that many Malaysians understand Singapore fundamentally. I don't get the same level of conversation with other southeast asians. So yeah, we are really brothers as countries, like it or not  But yeah tldr: stop the singapore worship! It's toxic  Still, singaporeans giving textbook answers and not getting my post.  My premise is Malaysia is not that bad. If it is, why are there so many expats also living here and not Singapore, or back home in their higher quality countries? Im talking about Japanese, Americans,Europeans and the list goes on. Even Singaporeans live in Malaysia even if you know none they're there.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"post_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 554,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2409,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 142,\n        \"samples\": [\n          289,\n          3,\n          36\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"upvote_ratio\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.09405998920094921,\n        \"min\": 0.2,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 37,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.84,\n          0.8,\n          0.78\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 131,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 584,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 108,\n        \"samples\": [\n          112,\n          20,\n          47\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"created_utc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 60514572.96698371,\n        \"min\": 1423308347.0,\n        \"max\": 1749629147.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 190,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1679133868.0,\n          1719672682.0,\n          1597618504.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comment_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13241,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"lob8uzu\",\n          \"hc5zrok\",\n          \"mr0k1qn\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comment_body\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12841,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Thank you man, yeah I'm in events so tattoos are not as big of a problem like in other industries\",\n          \"You should watch youtube instead of recording.\",\n          \"Anyone should be entitled and enabled to enter or exit any religion they wish.

I asked my travel agent today to ask the airline what will be the procedure for her entry, you know, just to be sure. He called and this stupid guy on the other end said that my sister, even tho has a UK PASSPORT also need a Malaysian visa. Now my travel agent has been asking around and i have been searching through the internet and every website says that you do NOT need a Malaysian Visa if you have a British passport.   Can someone here with a British passport who have been to Malaysia in recent times assure me that my sister does not need a visa. I'll repay you with good vibes and prayers and all that. Thank you.\",\n          \"I'm a college dropout, my first business was a success (peak T2-T3 income in kl) but being young, rich, and naive caused me to learn all the bad habits and be stagnant all the way until now (I'm early 30s M).  I didn't realize the harmful effect of being stagnant as I am comfortable since I am still having T15 income at such young age. Covid came and my business went downhill quickly, expecting my wife would at least support me mentally but instead she drained what is left in me and left, I have had suicidal thoughts from time to time since then.   Luckily I have savings, and my business is dying but still making some profits, otherwise, I think I will end up in the news and won't be posting here on Reddit already.  I am into tech business competing in the international markets, and being stagnant in this field is worse than in other fields. Currently, I have a few other projects in mind which are a lot more challenging and higher risk than the first one. I don't want to depend on third-party for the technical aspects of my business this time, just like it is a bad idea to open a restaurant if we don't know how to cook.  I already had production experience as I no longer depend on the third party to maintain my business, albeit only copy-paste and make adjustments most of the time I have confidence I can be a decent programmer if I dive deep into it. So I intend to invest a few years in hardcore learning, practice, and build everything by myself from scratch, from front-end to security.   I had finally learned not to put all the eggs in one basket, IT businesses can be easier to do part-time due to automation, so I wish to establish myself in corporate after I can call myself a full-stack programmer and have some non-hobby portfolio to show.   People say landing a job without connections is very difficult, not to mention I don't have a degree and I'm already in my mid 30s by the time I can call myself a full-stack developer and I have to compete with fresh uni grads. The more I think about this the more depressed I am. I really don't want to end up doing grab etc just to survive, that should be the last resort if I decided I wanted to continue to live.  Does anyone have guidance for me or have any success stories to share? I don't know what to do if my next business doesn't succeed. I just want a reset, but time doesn't flow backward :(\",\n          \"Simple. If living in Singapore has the same wage and cost of living as malaysia, Singaporeans would be desperate to leave.   Other than public transport and cleanliness and \\\"less corruption\\\" (really its debateable when we don't know what really goes on behind..) there's really nothing more to Singapore than just another westernised city.  Malaysia is a proper sized country with things to do, and the people here are suprisingly warmer and friendlier and the country actually has a culture.  Singapore just feels like a hollow city compared to Malaysia.   [Edit] probably some singaporeans are gonna be salty about it but its just my experience. I make good friends in SG too. But again its just my observations. And anecdotally I find many agree. How can we quantify culture on statistics? Hard to do. But ask most travelers about what they think of Singapore and they'll hardly ever mention culture. It's just a harsh reality of materialistic cities. But I find Singapore in comparison to Malaysia to be far colder, even when compared to KL.  Only downside of Malaysia is low income. Only upside of Singapore is high income. But we have to be careful with our expenses regardless.  As a half malaysian, part of me wished I instead had malaysian citizenship and Singaporean PR. That's the best of both worlds.   So i can empathise with the loathing of the government and all. But really, the grass isn't all that green here in Singapore. Recent survey show half of youngsters here having anxiety and depression. Good infrastructure and efficiency doesn't solve everything guys. Focusing so much on such can create new problems.  Plus the fact that Singapore is so small and claustraphobic. Does it surprise me that everytime they want to go Johor?  Also this extends further than Malaysia. I've heard similar complaints about life in SG comparing to others like Vietnam or Thailand for example (normally they marry a Viet or Thai or Indo then they have the option to move). Some try something new like New Zealand, some go back to their home country with their hard earned money. Many Singaporeans just retire overseas.  [Edit] Some people want to point out that Malaysia has similar levels of stress or anxiety but shouldn't it make you question why Singapore, an efficient,clean and modern country, has all the same levels of anxiety as that of Malaysia which has obviously less of the efficiency , cleanliness or safety of Singapore?  Also no its not a \\\"i want to move to malaysia\\\" post or \\\"i hate singapore\\\" post. It's more of looking at the countries' strengths and weaknesses, and for me a realisation that this whole idea of \\\"Singapore is just better all the time\\\" idea kind of needs to stop, which is the whole point of my post  Also I'm shocked by the number of agreeing comments, with some describing how I feel and even more accurately so. Talking to Malaysians in real life also, I get the sense that many Malaysians understand Singapore fundamentally. I don't get the same level of conversation with other southeast asians. So yeah, we are really brothers as countries, like it or not  But yeah tldr: stop the singapore worship! It's toxic  Still, singaporeans giving textbook answers and not getting my post.  My premise is Malaysia is not that bad. If it is, why are there so many expats also living here and not Singapore, or back home in their higher quality countries? Im talking about Japanese, Americans,Europeans and the list goes on. Even Singaporeans live in Malaysia even if you know none they're there.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"post_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 554,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2409,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 142,\n        \"samples\": [\n          289,\n          3,\n          36\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"upvote_ratio\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.09405998920094921,\n        \"min\": 0.2,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 37,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.84,\n          0.8,\n          0.78\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 131,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 584,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 108,\n        \"samples\": [\n          112,\n          20,\n          47\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"created_utc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 60514572.96698371,\n        \"min\": 1423308347.0,\n        \"max\": 1749629147.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 190,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1679133868.0,\n          1719672682.0,\n          1597618504.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comment_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13241,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"lob8uzu\",\n          \"hc5zrok\",\n          \"mr0k1qn\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comment_body\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12841,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Thank you man, yeah I'm in events so tattoos are not as big of a problem like in other industries\",\n          \"You should watch youtube instead of recording.\",\n          \"Anyone should be entitled and enabled to enter or exit any religion they wish.

I asked my travel agent today to ask the airline what will be the procedure for her entry, you know, just to be sure. He called and this stupid guy on the other end said that my sister, even tho has a UK PASSPORT also need a Malaysian visa. Now my travel agent has been asking around and i have been searching through the internet and every website says that you do NOT need a Malaysian Visa if you have a British passport.   Can someone here with a British passport who have been to Malaysia in recent times assure me that my sister does not need a visa. I'll repay you with good vibes and prayers and all that.

I didn't realize the harmful effect of being stagnant as I am comfortable since I am still having T15 income at such young age. Covid came and my business went downhill quickly, expecting my wife would at least support me mentally but instead she drained what is left in me and left, I have had suicidal thoughts from time to time since then.   Luckily I have savings, and my business is dying but still making some profits, otherwise, I think I will end up in the news and won't be posting here on Reddit already.  I am into tech business competing in the international markets, and being stagnant in this field is worse than in other fields. Currently, I have a few other projects in mind which are a lot more challenging and higher risk than the first one. I don't want to depend on third-party for the technical aspects of my business this time, just like it is a bad idea to open a restaurant if we don't know how to cook.  I already had production experience as I no longer depend on the third party to maintain my business, albeit only copy-paste and make adjustments most of the time I have confidence I can be a decent programmer if I dive deep into it. So I intend to invest a few years in hardcore learning, practice, and build everything by myself from scratch, from front-end to security.   I had finally learned not to put all the eggs in one basket, IT businesses can be easier to do part-time due to automation, so I wish to establish myself in corporate after I can call myself a full-stack programmer and have some non-hobby portfolio to show.   People say landing a job without connections is very difficult, not to mention I don't have a degree and I'm already in my mid 30s by the time I can call myself a full-stack developer and I have to compete with fresh uni grads. The more I think about this the more depressed I am. I really don't want to end up doing grab etc just to survive, that should be the last resort if I decided I wanted to continue to live.  Does anyone have guidance for me or have any success stories to share? I don't know what to do if my next business doesn't succeed. I just want a reset, but time doesn't flow backward :(\",\n          \"Simple. If living in Singapore has the same wage and cost of living as malaysia, Singaporeans would be desperate to leave.   Other than public transport and cleanliness and \\\"less corruption\\\" (really its debateable when we don't know what really goes on behind..) there's really nothing more to Singapore than just another westernised city.  Malaysia is a proper sized country with things to do, and the people here are suprisingly warmer and friendlier and the country actually has a culture.  Singapore just feels like a hollow city compared to Malaysia.   [Edit] probably some singaporeans are gonna be salty about it but its just my experience. I make good friends in SG too. But again its just my observations. And anecdotally I find many agree. How can we quantify culture on statistics? Hard to do. But ask most travelers about what they think of Singapore and they'll hardly ever mention culture. It's just a harsh reality of materialistic cities. But I find Singapore in comparison to Malaysia to be far colder, even when compared to KL.  Only downside of Malaysia is low income. Only upside of Singapore is high income. But we have to be careful with our expenses regardless.  As a half malaysian, part of me wished I instead had malaysian citizenship and Singaporean PR. That's the best of both worlds.   So i can empathise with the loathing of the government and all. But really, the grass isn't all that green here in Singapore. Recent survey show half of youngsters here having anxiety and depression. Good infrastructure and efficiency doesn't solve everything guys. Focusing so much on such can create new problems.  Plus the fact that Singapore is so small and claustraphobic. Does it surprise me that everytime they want to go Johor?  Also this extends further than Malaysia. I've heard similar complaints about life in SG comparing to others like Vietnam or Thailand for example (normally they marry a Viet or Thai or Indo then they have the option to move). Some try something new like New Zealand, some go back to their home country with their hard earned money. Many Singaporeans just retire overseas.  [Edit] Some people want to point out that Malaysia has similar levels of stress or anxiety but shouldn't it make you question why Singapore, an efficient,clean and modern country, has all the same levels of anxiety as that of Malaysia which has obviously less of the efficiency , cleanliness or safety of Singapore?  Also no its not a \\\"i want to move to malaysia\\\" post or \\\"i hate singapore\\\" post. It's more of looking at the countries' strengths and weaknesses, and for me a realisation that this whole idea of \\\"Singapore is just better all the time\\\" idea kind of needs to stop, which is the whole point of my post  Also I'm shocked by the number of agreeing comments, with some describing how I feel and even more accurately so. Talking to Malaysians in real life also, I get the sense that many Malaysians understand Singapore fundamentally. I don't get the same level of conversation with other southeast asians. So yeah, we are really brothers as countries, like it or not  But yeah tldr: stop the singapore worship! It's toxic  Still, singaporeans giving textbook answers and not getting my post.  My premise is Malaysia is not that bad. If it is, why are there so many expats also living here and not Singapore, or back home in their higher quality countries? Im talking about Japanese, Americans,Europeans and the list goes on. Even Singaporeans live in Malaysia even if you know none they're there.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"post_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 554,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2409,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 142,\n        \"samples\": [\n          289,\n          3,\n          36\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"upvote_ratio\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.09405998920094921,\n        \"min\": 0.2,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 37,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.84,\n          0.8,\n          0.78\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 131,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 584,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 108,\n        \"samples\": [\n          112,\n          20,\n          47\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"created_utc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 60514572.96698371,\n        \"min\": 1423308347.0,\n        \"max\": 1749629147.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 190,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1679133868.0,\n          1719672682.0,\n          1597618504.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comment_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13241,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"lob8uzu\",\n          \"hc5zrok\",\n          \"mr0k1qn\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comment_body\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12841,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Thank you man, yeah I'm in events so tattoos are not as big of a problem like in other industries\",\n          \"You should watch youtube instead of recording.\",\n          \"Anyone should be entitled and enabled to enter or exit any religion they wish.
