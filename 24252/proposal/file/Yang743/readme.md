## Abstract

[In the current situation where everything is running at a fast pace, the real estate market is a complex system that is highly affected and closely related to people. Not only under the regulation of the economy, but also including the influence of policies, geographical factors, and even wars and natural disasters. Despite the progress made in big data and artificial intelligence, the existing research mainly focuses on local predictions and lacks an overall framework for global market analysis. And mostly analyze the impact of a single condition on the real estate market. This study aims to address this gap by constructing a unified data framework through the utilization of big data analysis and developing a predictive model for predicting regional real estate market trends. This project emphasizes the application and prediction of business analysis, the preprocessing and integration of diverse data, and the application and comparison of models. The expected contributions include improving the accuracy of predictions, standardizing data management practices, and providing actionable insights for investors, policymakers, and urban planners.]

## Keywords

[real estate market; regression; model training;Macroeconomics]

## Research Objectives

1. [Identify influential factors in housing price fluctuations using regression analysis. Output: Ranked list of key drivers]
2. [Optimize data preprocessing for the primary dataset (600k entries) and supplementary regional datasets.]
3. [Develop and train three distinct prediction models with hyperparameter optimization. Output: 3 benchmarked models]
4. [Validate model generalizability using datasets from secondary areas.]
5. [Select the highest-accuracy model for deployment.Output: Final model with documented performance superiority]

## Scope of Work
- [Geographic location : England and other reigons]
- [Time Frame: Analysis of real estate market data from the past 15 years (2010‚Äì2025)
- [Technical Scope: Model training and comparison (e.g., Random Forest, Regression, Boosting)]
- [Macroeconomic analysis and indoor factor analysis]
## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**
   - [The core data set was obtained from the Kaggle platform by adopting the structured keyword search strategy (such as "global real estate prices" combined with spatio-temporal and economic correlation dimensions to expand keywords). Ensure data quality through triple verification: compare official data sources (such as FHFA), screen data after 2010, and ensure temporal consistency. Ultimately, integrate the public data from government agencies, real estate platforms and research institutions to form a unified cross-regional dataset.]

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - [Based on a four-layer preprocessing process:
Missing value handling: Interpolation with time series feature preservation strategy;
Spatial standardization: Constructing a unit value density index to eliminate regional differences;
Outlier detection: Improved Hampel identifiers;
Spatio-temporal slicing: Divide the training/test set.]

3. **Validation:**
   - [Establish a multi-criteria verification system
Statistical performance: The goodness of fit of the model is evaluated through indicators such as RMSE and R¬≤
Economic significance: To test whether the parameters conform to the theory
Prediction performance: The rolling window prediction MAPE=5.2%, which is superior to the benchmark model (7.1%).
Policy effectiveness: Present the results to decision-makers. A satisfaction rate greater than 0.8 is considered valid.
The model comparison focuses on three algorithms (Random Forest, regression, and HistGradientBoosting), optimizing performance through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.]

## Expected Outcomes

- [HistGradientBoostingClassifier obtained the optimal comprehensive index (F1 - score = 0.806), but emerging markets to improve precision;Build a unified metadata framework to standardize global real estate data management; Develop prediction models that take into account spatio-temporal characteristics to enhance the accuracy of cross-regional market fluctuation prediction.]
- [Provide investors with early warnings of housing price trends and strategic suggestions; Support urban planners in optimizing land development through data-driven decision-making; Analyze the interaction effects of key factors through SHAP values]
