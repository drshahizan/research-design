## Abstract

In the aviation industry, flight delays have a significantly impact on passenger satisfaction, operational management, and financial costs. In this study, a flight delay prediction model is developed using machine learning techniques to identify flights that are likely to be delayed based on operational and weather related data. There are a number of features included in the dataset, such as departure and arrival times, airline, weather conditions, and airport traffic information, to name a few. There have been three types of machine learning models developed and compared like Random Forest, XGBoost, and a Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (ATT-BI-LSTM). A comparative analysis of that ATT-BI-LSTM model the bi-LSTM model showed that the ATT-BI-LSTM model was the most accurate and able to accurately detect actual flight delays out of the bunch. As a result of this study machine learning can be used in aviation to predict flight delays earlier, help to make proactive decisions, and reduce the impact of delays on operations and customer service.

## Research Objectives

a)	To collect and process flight and weather data for delay prediction

b)	To have a machine learning model for classifying delayed flights, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and ATT-BI-LSTM, developed and compared.

c)	To identify the best model based on ROC-AUC, F1-score, and accuracy-precision metric.
