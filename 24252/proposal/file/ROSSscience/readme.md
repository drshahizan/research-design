## Abstract

[This introduces DeepPhishX, a multimodal deep learning system specifically designed to detect phishing web pages, a task that is critical in the field of cybersecurity and data protection. Traditional methods rely mainly on URL feature analysis, but they cannot effectively identify the multi-layered logic of advanced phishing attacks. To this end, DeepPhishX innovatively combines URL& feature analysis with HTML DOM graph structure modeling and uses a variety of model fusion methods such as Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), Character-level Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Word Sequence Transformer to achieve in-depth analysis of the structure and content of phishing web pages.
We rigorously evaluated DeepPhishX on a dataset that covers real-world web page data (HTML DOM graphs and URLs, totaling more than 80 million nodes/edges) from 2012 to 2024. The experimental results show that compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, DeepPhishX improves the classification accuracy by 7.03 percentage points, and the ablation experiment also shows that each feature module has a significant contribution to the performance. These results verify the effectiveness of hybrid deep learning in combining DOM structure and URL features and prove that DeepPhishX can provide a more accurate and comprehensive solution for identifying malicious web pages.]

## Research Objectives

1. [Build a hybrid deep-learning model that fuses CNN, Transformer, and GCN to analyze URL and webpage structures.]
2. [Boost phishing detection by improving accuracy by ~7% and ensuring robustness against adversarial attacks.]
3. [Scale validation using a large real-world dataset (2012‚Äì2024, 80M+ nodes/edges) with thorough experiments.]

## Scope of Work
- [Data Collection & Preprocessing]
- [Gather URLs and DOMs (2012‚Äì2024, ~80M nodes/edges).]
- [Encode URLs (ASCII matrix + token sequences) and parse DOMs into graphs.]

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**
   - [We gathered URLs and HTML data from reputable phishing repositories such as PhishTank and OpenPhish, and benign websites from sources like the University of New Brunswick benign URL dataset]

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - [We applied feature extraction on three modalities: (a) character-level URL matrices for CNN; (b) tokenized URL sequences for Transformer models; (c) DOM-tree graphs parsed from HTML for GCN processing, leveraging network libraries and custom scripts.]

3. **Validation:**
   - [Model performance was validated using k-fold cross-validation (k=10), and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were reported. We also conducted ablation studies and adversarial tests.]

## Expected Outcomes

- [Improved Detection Performance
Demonstrate a significant boost in phishing detection accuracy‚Äîtargeting +7% improvement over current state-of-the-art‚Äîby integrating multimodal features and ensemble learning models.
]
-[A Validated, Open-Source Dataset & Framework
Release a comprehensive benchmark dataset (URLs + DOM graphs) and publish the DeepPhish‚ÄëX implementation for community use and reproducibility.]
