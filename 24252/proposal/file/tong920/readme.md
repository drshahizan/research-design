## Abstract

This research endeavors to establish a prediction model for tropical cyclone landing points grounded in the random forest regression model, with a particular emphasis on cyclone activities within the Northwest Pacific region. The research data is sourced from the tropical cyclone trajectory information in the IBTrACS dataset spanning from 2020 to 2025. The model utilizes wind speed and air pressure as the primary input features to forecast the latitude and longitude of the tropical cyclone landing points.

In the course of this study, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was initially carried out. Subsequently, feature selection, model training, testing, and result evaluation were completed. After data cleaning, a total of 14,908 valid samples were acquired and partitioned into a training set and a testing set at a ratio of 8:2. The experimental findings indicate that the random forest model exhibits excellent performance in addressing the nonlinear relationships and outliers among variables. The average absolute errors of the model in the tasks of latitude and longitude prediction are 5.51 and 10.75, respectively. The stability and predictive capabilities of the model were further corroborated through error distribution plots and scatter plots.

This research not only offers an effective means of enhancing the prediction accuracy of cyclone landing points but also showcases the latent value of data-driven methodologies in the construction of coastal disaster prevention, mitigation, and early warning systems.

## Keywords

Random Forest Regression; Meteorological Data Analysis; Machine Learning

## Research Objectives

1. Construct a random forest model: Based on the tropical cyclone trajectories and environmental variables in the IBTrACS dataset, develop a prediction model for tropical cyclone landing points in the surrounding sea areas of Malaysia (with the output of longitude and latitude coordinates).
2. Analysis of Key Influencing Factors: Through feature importance analysis and nonlinear modeling, quantify the dynamic influence of sea surface temperature, topography and atmospheric conditions on the landing locations of tropical cyclones.

## Scope of Work
1. In terms of the geographical range, the tropical cyclone data from the surrounding sea areas of Malaysia (latitude and longitude range: 0¬∞ - 10¬∞N, 95¬∞ - 120¬∞E) are employed, with the tropical cyclone data from other regions excluded.
2.  Regarding the definition of landfall, a tropical cyclone is regarded as having landed if the distance between its center and the coastline of Malaysia is no more than 50 kilometers. The potential landfall points on the east coast (the side facing the South China Sea) are of key concern.
3. Concerning the prediction duration, with the tropical cyclone entering the study area (latitude 0¬∞‚Äì20¬∞N, longitude 100¬∞‚Äì120¬∞E) as the starting point, the landing point within the next 72 hours is predicted.
4. Employing the relevant data in the IBTrACS dataset, a tropical cyclone landing point prediction model is established.
5. The impacts of key factors, such as climate and terrain, on the landing points of tropical cyclones will be analyzed.
