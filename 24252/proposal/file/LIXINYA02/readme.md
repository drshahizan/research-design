## Abstract

This study is based on the student course evaluation data from the RateMyProfessor platform, integrating structured ratings and text comments. By applying natural language processing and machine learning methods, a course satisfaction prediction model is constructed. Through data cleaning, feature fusion, and model training, the results show that the fusion of features significantly improves the prediction performance, with the LSTM model achieving the highest accuracy. The study also uses SHAP and LIME methods to analyze feature importance and explain the model results. This research provides a scientific, personalized, and interpretable intelligent analysis tool for higher education teaching evaluation, contributing to the improvement and optimization of teaching quality management.

## Keywords

Course evaluation; Text mining; Sentiment analysis; Machine learning

## Research Objectives

1. Carry out preprocessing and extract sentiment features by means of natural language processing techniques.

2. Construct satisfaction prediction models through the utilization of machine learning (such as random forests and long short-term memory networks).

3. Employ SHAP and LIME to identify the key influencing factors.


## Scope of Work
(a)	Choose the student teaching evaluation data from public educational evaluation platforms (e.g., RateMyProfessor), encompassing structured data (quantitative indicators such as course ratings, teacher ratings, and course difficulty) and unstructured data (students' textual comments on courses and teachers).

(b)	Eliminate missing values and outliers in the collected initial data to guarantee the quality and reliability of the data.

(c)	Adopt conventional natural language processing approaches, including word segmentation, stop word removal, and word vector representations (e.g., TF- IDF), and carry out three-class sentiment analysis (positive, neutral, negative).

(d)	For the modeling section, traditional machine learning algorithms such as random forest and deep learning methods like LSTM will be utilized to control computational resources.

(e)	Incorporate interpretability tools such as SHAP and LIME to identify the key factors influencing satisfaction prediction, with an emphasis on explaining the top five major features.
