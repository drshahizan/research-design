## Abstract

[This study explores the predictive power of Twitter sentiment on Ethereum (ETH) price dynamics using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Given the growing influence of social media in financial markets, especially among cryptocurrency traders, the research focuses on extracting and analyzing sentiment signals from English-language tweets mentioning Ethereum. A multimodal methodology is employed, combining lexicon-based tools (e.g., VADER), domain-specific models (e.g., FinBERT and CryptoBERT), and visual sentiment features such as emojis and GIFs. Sentiment scores are aligned with Ethereum market data‚Äîprice, volume, and volatility‚Äîover a six-month period. Deep learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and hybrid architectures, are trained to forecast ETH market movements. To enhance transparency and real-world applicability, the study integrates explainable AI (XAI) tools like SHAP and attention visualization. Preliminary findings reveal that aggregated sentiment‚Äîespecially from influential users‚Äîcorrelates strongly with ETH price direction and volatility, with lagged sentiment signals showing short-term predictive power. Furthermore, emotion clustering and multimodal sentiment enhance the accuracy of forecasting models, capturing meme-driven and speculative behaviors often missed by traditional financial metrics. This research contributes a replicable framework for crypto-financial sentiment modeling, offering insights for traders, analysts, and DeFi platforms aiming to leverage real-time social media intelligence in high-volatility markets.]

## Keywords

[	1.	Sentiment Analysis
	2.	Ethereum (ETH)
	3.	Twitter Data
	4.	Machine Learning
	5.	Multimodal Forecasting]

## Research Objectives

1. [Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to conduct sentiment analysis]
2. [Compile tweets about Ethereum over a predetermined period of time. ]
3. [Establish a correlation between sentiment scores and trading volumes and ETH price changes. ]

## Scope of Work
- [Only looked at Ethereum-related data from Twitter.]
- [Classify sentiment in English-language tweets.]

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**
   - [Through the Twitter Streaming API (v2)]

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - [VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) ]
   - [FinBERT] 


3. **Validation:**
   - [Use evaluation indicators such as MAE, Accuracy, F1, AUC, etc.]

## Expected Outcomes

- [Importance of Data Cleaning: Effective data preprocessing, including cleaning and tokenization, significantly improves the quality of sentiment data. Without proper cleaning, noise in the data can lead to misleading sentiment classification.]
- [Model Selection: VADER combined with FinBERT and CryptoBERT provides a powerful sentiment classification system that addresses the unique challenges of cryptocurrency languages.]
