# 🧩 Sentiment Analysis of Ethereum (ETH) on Twitter

A data science project to analyze public sentiment towards Ethereum (ETH) using Twitter data and explore its potential correlation with ETH price movements.

## 📌 Project Overview

The cryptocurrency market is highly sensitive to social media sentiment.  
This project focuses on analyzing tweets related to Ethereum (ETH) to understand how public opinion influences market dynamics.  
I apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis and visualize the relationship between Twitter sentiment and ETH price trends.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Collect Ethereum-related tweets using Twitter API.
- Clean and preprocess the tweet data for analysis.
- Perform sentiment analysis using NLP algorithms (VADER/TextBlob).
- Visualize sentiment trends and ETH price movements.
- Analyze the correlation between public sentiment and ETH market behavior.
- Present actionable insights and data-driven conclusions.

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Fetch Ethereum-related tweets using Twitter API.
   - Retrieve ETH market data (price, volume) from CoinGecko API.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Remove URLs, hashtags, mentions, emojis, and special characters.
   - Tokenization, stop word removal, text normalization.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Apply VADER/TextBlob to assign sentiment scores to tweets.
   - Classify sentiment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

4. **Data Analysis**  
   - Time series alignment of sentiment scores and ETH price data.
   - Perform correlation analysis to identify patterns and trends.

5. **Visualization & Reporting**  
   - Create visual dashboards of sentiment trends and price movements.
   - Prepare a final report summarizing insights and conclusions.
