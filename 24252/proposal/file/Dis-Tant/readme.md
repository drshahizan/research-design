## Abstract

The sentiment classification of Yelp reviews is hindered by significant challenges, including "semantic-label bias," the opaque "black-box" nature of deep learning models, and the common underutilization of structured metadata. These issues critically limit the performance and trustworthiness of classifiers, especially in fine-grained five-star rating scenarios. This research proposes an interpretable, metadata-enhanced framework to address these problems. The primary objective is to improve the accuracy and transparency of sentiment prediction by effectively integrating deep textual semantics, derived from a pre-trained BERT model, with structured business attributes such as category and location.
The proposed framework utilizes machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, built upon the fused textual and metadata features. A key contribution of this work is the application of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to demystify the model's decision-making process. By leveraging SHAP, the framework provides transparent insights into feature importance and analyzes the mechanisms behind misclassifications, particularly for ambiguous, adjacent ratings. This study, therefore, delivers a sentiment analysis model that balances high accuracy with interpretability, offering a more reliable and trustworthy solution for the practical analysis of user feedback.

## Keywords

## Research Objectives

1. To construct a five-class sentiment prediction model integrating Yelp review text semantics with business structured metadata, and evaluate its performance improvement in terms of classification accuracy and generalization ability.
2. To apply the SHAP method to reveal the internal decision logic of the constructed model in the sentiment classification task, and identify key text features and business attributes that significantly influence prediction results.
3. To combine SHAP interpretation results with confusion matrix analysis to deeply explore and visualize the model's misclassification patterns and their underlying mechanisms when distinguishing fine-grained ratings (especially 4-star and 5-star).

## Scope of Work
- Data Source and Type: Publicly available English text reviews, 1-5 star rating labels, and business metadata from the Yelp platform will be used. The study focuses on single-language (English) text and does not include multilingual processing or multimodal data such as images or audio.
- Model Construction and Complexity: The focus is on building a five-class sentiment prediction model that integrates textual semantic features extracted by BERT with structured metadata. The model will be based on established machine learning classification algorithms and will not extend to developing entirely new end-to-end deep learning architectures (except for BERT itself) or more complex models like graph neural networks.
- Explainability Method and Analysis Depth: The SHAP method will be primarily used to analyze the model's decision process and the influence of key features. Confusion matrix analysis will be combined to analyze and visualize misclassifications of fine-grained ratings (particularly 4-star and 5-star). The study does not involve advanced explainability techniques such as model retraining based on explanation feedback, causal inference, or generating natural language explanations.
- Implementation Environment and Nature of Results: Experiments will be conducted using Python and standard machine learning/NLP libraries in a standard research environment such as local setup or Colab. The research outcomes are intended for theoretical validation and understanding model behavior, and do not involve large-scale system deployment, production environment applications, or user interface development.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**
   - This study uses data from the Yelp platform. The public Yelp dataset was too large and had issues. So, the research uses a custom web crawler to collect data. The crawler gathers English-language user reviews. It also collects structured metadata. This metadata includes star ratings, business categories, and city locations.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Techniques:
     - The study uses a pre-trained BERT model to extract text features.
     - It also uses metadata features like business category and city.
     - Text features and metadata are combined using vector concatenation. This creates a fused feature set.
     - The research uses Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) as classifiers.
     - It uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain the model's decisions.
     - It also analyzes the confusion matrix to understand misclassifications.
   - Tools:
     -  Experiments use Python.
     -  Standard machine learning and NLP libraries are used.
     -  The environment can be a local setup or Colab.

4. **Validation:**
   - The study validates its findings in several ways. It uses standard evaluation metrics. These metrics include accuracy, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. The research also performs comparative experiments. It compares baseline models that use only text features against the main model that uses fused features. This comparison validates the effectiveness of the feature fusion strategy.

## Expected Outcomes

- This project is expected to deliver several key results and contributions. The primary expected result is improved model accuracy.  This will be achieved by fusing text features with structured metadata. The fusion model is anticipated to significantly outperform text-only models. Another major contribution is the creation of a transparent and trustworthy model using the SHAP tool. This method will explain the model's "black box" decisions, identify key influencing features, and analyze why the model confuses similar ratings like 4-stars versus 5-stars. The research also contributes a reusable methodological framework for future studies.
- The thesis document does not state any intended publications. The scope of the project is for theoretical validation and understanding model behavior. The work will not involve large-scale system deployment or production applications. It also does not include the development of a user interface.
