## Abstract

[This study explores public sentiment on social media "X" (formerly Twitter) in response to the Trump administration‚Äôs 2025 China tariff policy. Using natural language processing (NLP) and the VADER sentiment analysis tool, the study analyzes English tweets from January to May 2025. A three-stage unsupervised analysis shows that negative sentiment dominates (60.4%), followed by positive (28.4%) and neutral (11.3%) emotions.

To improve classification performance, VADER compound scores are used to generate pseudo-labels for a balanced dataset. Supervised models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting are trained and compared. The soft voting ensemble of the three models achieves the highest accuracy at 73.05%.

This research proposes a semi-supervised sentiment analysis framework suitable for policy-sensitive topics, demonstrating that pseudo-labeling can be effectively used without manual annotation. It also reveals a strong correlation between policy intensity and emotional polarization‚Äîmore extreme policies trigger stronger emotional reactions and reduce space for rational discussion.

The study offers practical insights into public opinion dynamics during high-impact policy events and provides a methodological reference for researchers, policymakers, and analysts monitoring online discourse.
