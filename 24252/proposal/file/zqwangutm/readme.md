## Abstract

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a major area in natural language processing that focuses on identifying emotional tones and subjective attitudes within textual data. As the volume of user-generated content continues to grow‚Äîparticularly through social media platforms, online forums, and product reviews‚Äîsentiment analysis has become an essential tool for understanding public opinion, tracking consumer preferences, and analyzing social trends.

Over the past decade, research in this field has developed along several key technical paths. Traditional machine learning methods laid the groundwork for automated sentiment classification, while sentiment lexicon-based approaches provided interpretability and domain flexibility. More recently, deep learning techniques‚Äîespecially neural networks such as CNNs, RNNs, and transformers‚Äîhave greatly improved performance in complex sentiment tasks.

Despite these advances, challenges remain. Cross-lingual sentiment transfer, sarcasm and irony detection, and effective integration of multimodal information (e.g., text, image, audio) continue to be active research problems. Looking forward, the field is expected to move toward more accurate semantic comprehension, better adaptability to specific domains, and robust modeling across multiple languages and cultural contexts.

## Keywords

Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Text analysis; Word embedding

## Research Objectives

1. What are the similarities and differences in the emotions expressed by viewers in the three countries after watching the show?
2. Which emotional keywords or themes are most representative in the audience's comments?
3. Is there a relationship between the audience's emotional tendencies and their rating performance?

## Scope of Work
- Data Collection:From the community, more in-depth
- Model Category:Using a semi-supervised model is more conducive to subsequent data regression
- Analysis Content:In addition to positive and negative evaluations, extract the top words at both ends
- Research Limitation: Only the text itself is analyzed. In addition, the review sampling will be limited to user reviews published within one year of the movie's release

## Methodology
- Data Collection
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Sentiment Analysis Modeling
- Model evaluation and result comparison
## Expected Outcomes
Presents the differences in emotional reactions of audiences
in different countries to Nezha 2, and explains them by
combining keyword analysis and comment samples. The
sentiment analysis modelÔºàXGboostÔºâ is used as an auxiliary
tool in this study to help us reveal cross-national differences
in cultural acceptance, narrative style preferences, etc., and
provides data support for the subsequent overseas strategies
of Chinese films.
