## Abstract

This study explores the application of supervised machine learning models to predict Amazon Best Seller Rank (BSR) using structured product-level data. By collecting real-time information from Amazon‚Äôs software category, the research investigates how factors such as product price, star ratings, review volume, and geographic marketplace influence a product‚Äôs sales rank. Following comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory analysis, feature engineering was performed to enhance predictive power, introducing variables like review density, weighted rating, and log-transformed review counts.

Three regression models‚ÄîLinear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest‚Äîwere developed and evaluated using standard performance metrics including R¬≤, RMSE, and MAE. Among them, the Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest predictive accuracy, explaining over 57% of the variance in BSR and demonstrating strong generalisation in cross-validation. Feature importance analysis further revealed that review behaviour and pricing are key predictors of best seller status.

The findings support the value of ensemble learning and engineered features in modelling complex, non-linear outcomes in e-commerce settings. This research contributes both theoretically, by validating advanced modelling approaches, and practically, by offering a replicable framework that sellers and analysts can use to forecast product performance and inform strategic decisions.
