## Abstract

[The purpose of this study is to investigate the sentiment analsysis of electric vehicle discourse in Malaysia. The research was based on 3 primary objective. (a) to identify, preprocess, and explore EV-related textual data from online social platforms by implementing robust data cleaning and pattern discovery techniques; (b) to implement and compare the performance of pre-trained BERT-based models, specifically BERT-base uncased and RoBERTa-base, for structured sentiment analysis; and (c) to analyze the sentiment insights of Malaysians toward electric vehicles. Using VADER for initial sentiment labeling, both models were fine-tuned and evaluated. BERT-base uncased achieved a higher classification accuracy (93%) compared to RoBERTa-base (92%), particularly excelling in positive sentiment detection. The findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained language models for analyzing public opinion in EV-related discourse and suggest avenues for improvement through enhanced labeling strategies and experimentation with other transformer architectures.]

## Keywords

## Research Objectives

1. [To identify, preprocess and explore electric vehicle related text data from multiple online social media and implementing preprocessing procedure to clean data and discover underlying patterns.]
2. [To Implement and compare pre-trained Bert-based model in determining structured sentiment analysis.]
3. [To analyse the sentiment insight of Malaysian about electric vehicle.
1.6 Research Scope
The following]

## Scope of Work
- [This study will focus exclusively on analysis of discourse within Malaysian social media websites.]
- [The web crawler will be use to crawl on text data published between year 2021 until year 2025.]
- [The analysis only coverage English-language electric vehicle related textual data.]

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**
   - [Reddit Praw API]

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - [Vader for sentiment Labelling]
   - [BERT-based uncased and RoBERTA]

3. **Validation:**
   - [Classification report and confusion matrix]

## Expected Outcomes

- [Determine sentiment of the electric vehicle related discourse]
- [Compared which pretrained Bert based model is suitable for the classification]
