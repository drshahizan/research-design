## Abstract

Since online transactions have significantly increased due to the massive growth of E ‚Äì Commerce, fraud detection is a major concern for both consumers and businesses. So, deep learning methods such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short ‚Äì Term Memory (LSTM) models have been approached for detecting fraudulent transactions in online business platforms. The main aim is to evaluate and contrast how well these models performs correctly identifying fraudulent and non ‚Äì fraudulent transactions. A datasets of transaction records used to implement both models, with preprocessing steps including sequence modelling, data cleaning, and normalization. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model, performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score were used in this study. To conclude, the LSTM model is more suitable for predicting fraudulent activities patterns rather than RNN model.
## Keywords

Fraud Detection, E-Commerce, Deep Learning, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short - Term Memory (LSTM), Transaction

## Research Objectives

1. To investigate the deep learning ‚Äì based approach for fraud transactions detection.
2. To implement the method used for fraud transactions detections based on deep learning method.
3. To predict the accuracy of the model used for fraud transaction detection 

## Scope of Work
- The study utilizes the dataset of the synthetic dataset of Fraudulent activities in e-commerce.
- The experiment related will be developed in Python programming.
- The proposed model used Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short ‚Äì Term Memory (LSTM)
  
## Methodology

## Introduction

This section concerns research framework, data sources, preprocessing steps, model architecture and tools used to detect fraudulent transactions in e-commerce using deep learning methods. 

---

## Research Framework

This research consists of 5 Phases of Research Framework:

1. Phase 1: Initial Study
2. Phase 2: Data Preparation
3. Phase 3: Feature Extraction
4. Phase 4: Model Development
5. Phase 5: Analysis of Results

   
1. **Data Collection:**
- This synthetic dataset, "Fraudulent E-Commerce Transactions," is designed to simulate transaction data from an e-commerce platform with a focus on fraud detection. It contains a variety of features commonly found in transactional data, with additional attributes specifically engineered to support the development and testing of fraud detection algorithms.

2. **Data Analysis:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualization.
- Data Cleaning using Python tool
- Demographic of the Datasets (Overview)

3. **Validation:**
- Overall, the accuracy of RNN model is 75% and the recall for non ‚Äì fraudulent was higher with 76% same with fraudulent transactions. Meanwhile, the LSTM model performed similarly, total accuracy for non - fraudulent activities showed better 76% but the model still had trouble with the minority class of fraudulent transactions.

## Expected Outcomes
- LSTM Model perform slightly better than RNN Model for predict the fraudulent data.
