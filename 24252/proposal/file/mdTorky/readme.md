## Abstract

  In the digital era, social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) serve as active spaces for users to express opinions and share experiences about global events, including religious practices such as the Hajj pilgrimage. The rapid and voluminous generation of such user-generated content makes manual analysis impractical, necessitating automated solutions. This study aims to analyze public sentiment toward Hajj by applying sentiment analysis techniques to English-language tweets. Using simple machine learning models and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools such as VADER and TextBlob, the project classifies Hajj-related tweets into three sentiment categories: positive, negative, and neutral. The research involves data collection, preprocessing, sentiment classification, and result visualization using charts and word clouds. The findings provide insight into how the global community perceives Hajj, highlighting dominant emotions, frequently used words, and sentiment trends. This research contributes to understanding online religious discourse and offers a lightweight, domain-specific tool that Islamic organizations, researchers, and policymakers can use to monitor public perception of Hajj on social media.

## Keywords

Hajj, Sentiment Analysis, Islamic Pilgrimage

## Research Objectives

1. To collect and preprocess Hajj-related tweet data from X (formerly Twitter).
2. To develop a sentiment analysis model using simple machine learning and NLP techniques to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
3. To visualize the sentiment classification results using appropriate techniques such as charts and word clouds to represent sentiment trends.

## Scope of Work
- The dataset will consist exclusively of Hajj-related tweets collected from X (formerly Twitter).
- Only English-language tweets will be included to maintain compatibility with the selected sentiment analysis tools and models.
- Sentiment will be categorized into three classes: positive, negative, and neutral.
- The implementation will be done using the Python programming language
- Python libraries such as NLTK, VADER, and TextBlob will be used for natural language processing and sentiment classification.

## Methodology

The Data Science Project Life Cycle (DSPLC) is a systematic and iterative framework that provides a structured approach to solve data-driven problems. It acts as a guide from problem definition to solution delivery. For this project, the DSPLC offers a blueprint to ensure each stage ‚Äî from data collection to sentiment visualization ‚Äî is logically organized and efficiently executed

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Here, the raw data is gathered required to address the defined problem. This project collects tweets from X (formerly Twitter) that are related to Hajj using specific keywords and hashtags. This ensures the dataset contains relevant and targeted content needed for sentiment analysis.
     
2. **Data Analysis:**
   - EDA is crucial for understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships in the dataset. In this study, EDA involves examining tweet frequency, sentiment distributions, and the most frequently occurring terms to uncover hidden trends or anomalies in the data.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - The model's performance is assessed using accuracy and qualitative reviews. Since no labelled dataset is available, sample evaluation is used to confirm that the tool correctly interprets the sentiment of various tweet examples

## Expected Outcomes

  The research focuses on developing a sentiment classification algorithm that can accurately characterize Hajj-related tweets as favorable, negative, or neutral. To improve the transmission of sentiment patterns, visualization tools such as charts and word clouds are used, which provide an efficient way of data presentation. The findings of this analysis can be extremely useful for Islamic groups, researchers, and legislators, allowing them to better understand public mood and solve concerns about the Hajj journey. Finally, the objective is to develop a lightweight, domain-specific sentiment analysis tool for religious discourse on social media, making it both accessible and useful for studying debates about this key religious event.
